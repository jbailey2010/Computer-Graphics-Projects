My flight simulator read-me

Rotation (pitch/roll/yaw) is done with a complex vector system class, a normal vector class, and a camera object that keeps track of its own position and direction. All in one file. I know that's frowned upon, but to one-up that, I copy-pasted mountain.cpp into here, so I went all out on bad style in that regard.

Controls are:
These are the controls I added because I'd like 5% extra, or quite possibly misread the instructions. Regardless, that's a win-win as I'd cover everything at worst
u   Speed up
d   Slow down
I thought yawing was required originally, so I implemented those (below)
l   Yaw/Rudder left
r   Yaw/Rudder right

These are the required implementations
up      Rotate up
down    Rotate down
left    Rotate left
right   Rotate right


Directions to run it are very simple, make will compile it and ./mp2 should run it.
